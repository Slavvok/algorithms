Problem:

There is a two-dimensional list: [[2], [3], [4, 1]]
and a regular list of numbers: [3, 2, 1, 4].
Unpack a two-dimensional list so the numbers could be put in the order just like in the second list.
Note:
1. Numbers could be placed in a different position after unpacking.
2. Numbers order in the second level lists could not be changed.

Function would return False with the numbers above as the inner list order could not be changed.

[3, 2, 1, 4] != [3, 2, 4, 1]
